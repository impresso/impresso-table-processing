This repository contains the code used in Arthur Vernet's Master's Thesis on ***Automatic table detection and detection in large-scale newspaper archives***.

It is organized as follows:
* experiments: Contains code for preparing and running experiments; it should be copied on the machine where these will be ran.
* helpers: Contains helper files.
* letagger: Annotation GUI.
* NLL: Pre-processing, exploration and splits for the dataset NLL.
* RB: Pre-processing, exploration and splits for the dataset RB.

In each folder, a README explaining the use for each file can be found.

The thesis itself, which is a slightly different version from the graded one (fixed typos, modified splits and results on NLL-auto) can be found [here](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/291895).
