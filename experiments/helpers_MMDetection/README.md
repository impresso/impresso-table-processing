- config_MMDetection.json
    - an example of a config file to be used when running an experiment with MMDetection
- predict_MMDetection.sh
    - script to call the MMDetection library to infer predictions using a MMDetection model on a dataset given in a file like config_MMDetection.json
- prepare_MMDetection.py
    - prepare anything necessary to run an experiment using MMDetection
    - should be ran first
- results_MMDetection.py
    - after having generated predictions using predict_MMDetection.py, computes (semantic segmentation) results in terms of mIoU
- results_MMDetection.sh
    - after having generated predictions using predict_MMDetection.py, computes (object instance segmentation) results
- train_MMDetection.py
    - trains MMDetection using information given in a config.json file following the format of config_MMDetection.json
- visualization_MMDetection.ipynb
    - provides an example to visualize the predictions of a MMDetection model
